### 🗓️ Target Send Date
**At least 4 full business days lead time, subject to bandwidth and scope. (Build in enough time to edit, test, and approve emails and refine participant lists)**

###**Please indicate what type of research you are conducting. ie: Survey, in-depth interviews, diary, usability, etc.**

### ✍️ Content (FINAL copy, subject line, preview header)
**For translation requests, please see https://vault.shopify.io/pages/4095-Translation**

###CTA Link
**Specify if CTA link is static or dynamic and requires unique URL to match Shop or Partner ID**

### 👥 Audience (FINAL mode report/query or csv, no google sheets or excel/numbers files please)
**Note: We will only send merchant emails in the language that their admin is set to.**

###Tester's Email (up to 4 people)

###Target number of sign-ups or responses
***Most UXR emails only have 1-2% click rate and 20%-30% of English speaking merchants are unsubscribed. You can anticipate that the actual number of emails sent from your list of Shop or Partner IDs will be less. Ex: If you have 5000 Shop IDs the actual number of emails sent will likely be 3500 and your click rate potentially 35.***
